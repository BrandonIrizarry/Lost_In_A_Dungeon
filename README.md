## Background

You are lost in a maze, and need to find the way out.

Each time you enter the maze, it seems different each time.

Nevertheless, you are armed with a sword to fight anything that gets
in your way.

## Controls

Use w,a,s,d to move the player.

Use k to draw your sword, to kill the red crawlers.
